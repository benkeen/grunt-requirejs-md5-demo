# grunt-requirejs-md5-demo

An demo of how to combine the requireJS optimizer and grunt to generate bundled, md5-hash-renamed JS modules for a production site.

### The problem

All web developers have to contend with browser caches.


### How to install

First you need to download all the required node modules, including grunt. This assumes you have npm install (if not, there's oodles of resources on the internet
to explain how to do that).

`npm install`

Next, install the grunt command line tools. You may need to stick a `sudo` in front of this command in case you don't
have permissions.

`npm install -g grunt-cli`
